# North-Carolina-Financial-and-Health-Data
This repository holds information from 2014-2015 using data from North Carolina, which can be used to illustrate the effect a higher income has on overall health.
This data can be used to research how the financial system in North Carolina benefits overall health.

This repository has filtered down county data to only include 2014-2015 data from North Carolina counties, and include their respective Median Household Incomes, Poor/Fair Health rate, Uninsured Adults and Uninsured Children rates, and inadequate social support rates.

By including this data, we can compare overall county health relative to income and hopefully identify counties with high health relative to low income or high income and low health to identify where health problems are located in North Carolina.
