# North Carolina Financial and Health Data (2014-2015)

## Introduction
This repository provides data from North Carolina Counties for 2014-2015 that links financial health to physical health. County data includes County, Median Household Income, Poor or fair healthrates, the rate of uninsured adults, the rate of uninsured children, inadequate social support, the rate of those who could not see a doctor due to cost, and health care costs for each hospital.

## Purpose
This repository can be used for research into how finances play a role in the North Carolina healthcare system. By comparing different counties across North carolina, these statistics can hopefully show where improvements need to be made in order to reduce the amount of people unable to receive medical care.
